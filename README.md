# Scheherazade Client

This repo tracks the client-side code for
[Scheherazade](https://github.com/scheherazade-game).

## Getting started

0. `npm install && npm update` 
0. `grunt serve [--proxy-host <server-host*=localhost>] [--proxy-port <server-port*=4000>]`
0. Visit [localhost:8125](http://localhost:8125)

* This client (mostly) relies on having a working
[Scheherazade server](https://github.com/scheherazade-game/scheherazade-server). If
you're only developing locally, you'll need to install that.
